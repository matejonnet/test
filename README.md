GC: Hello Major Tom

MT: Hi Ground controll! I took the pills and put me helmet on. 

GC: Off you go, let God's love be with you.

GC: Tom! Are you leaving the capsule already ?

MT: Yap, I'm on my way out of the tin to see the stars.

MT: Our blue plannet looks nice!

MT: Far away from home, I don't know where to go.

GC: Tom, can you hear me!?

GC: Tom, can you hear me ... TOM!?
